      "title": "Offline Shopping Aid Gloves for the Visually Impaired",
      "description": "**Offline Shopping Aid Gloves for the Visually Impaired** Project addresses the significant challenges visually impaired people face during offline shopping due to the information accessibility gap. By focusing on sensory information processing, particularly visual cues which constitute 90% of the brain's input, our project aims to enhance shopping independence for visually impaired individuals.\n\n- The key innovation lies in specially designed gloves that assist with product recognition and navigation in stores. The gloves use built-in technology to provide auditory feedback about products, helping users identify items through barcode and color recognition features.\n- Addressing the lack of useful Braille on products, the gloves also aim to replace standard barcodes with Braille voice conversion codes, thus providing a practical solution to the real-world needs of the visually impaired.\n\n## Technical Specifications\n\n### 1. Right-Hand Glove Development for Color Identification and Product Classification\n\n#### 1.1 Implementation Goals and Components Used\n\nThe right-hand glove focuses on aiding visually impaired users by **providing color information of products**, which can be crucial for product differentiation. This glove utilizes an **RGB sensor** to detect the color of the item in hand and communicates this information through an auditory system powered by the **Arduino library Talkie**, converting color data into spoken words. This feature aims to assist in identifying and distinguishing products based on their color characteristics.\n\n#### 1.2 Construction and Functionality\n\nSimilar to the left-hand glove, the right-hand glove features tactile switches that trigger operations such as identifying and vocalizing colors. The glove was designed to perform under practical conditions, successfully identifying primary colors of widely known products. The glove’s exterior was also crafted using AUTOCAD and printed via 3D printing technology at Idea Factory, ensuring that the design is both functional and accessible for users.\n\n### 2. Left-Hand Glove Development\n\n#### 2.1 Implementation Goals and Components Used\n\nThe left-hand glove is engineered to assist visually impaired individuals by enabling them to identify products through **barcode scanning**. The glove integrates a barcode reader to scan and decode product barcodes, which are prevalent on product displays and packaging. This technology helps in determining what product it is by reading the barcode assigned to each product. Initially, the product utilized speakers for audio feedback; however, due to limitations, buzzers were used as substitutes to convey the product information audibly.\n\n#### 2.2 Construction and Functionality\n\nUpon pressing a button on the barcode reader, the device **activates and emits light** to facilitate barcode recognition. The glove was **tested** in a controlled environment, distinguishing canned beverages like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Mountain Dew based on their barcodes, which had been pre-registered in our database. Future developments could see the system connecting to a server for real-time data updates, expanding its utility.\n\nThe glove's cover was **designed using AUTOCAD** and **produced with a 3D printer** from KAIST Idea Factory. Specific features of the glove include holes for scanner button access, sound emission, and velcro attachments for easy detachment and reattachment of the device.",

It fundamentally transforms the digital ownership landscape by allowing the division of a single NFT into **multiple distinct fractions**, each uniquely owned and managed via smart contracts.\n\n# **Key Features**\n\n- **Fractional Ownership via ERC-1155**: The platform leverages the ERC-1155 standard, which permits the creation of multiple token types within a single contract, enabling each fraction to be a fully tradable and individually owned asset. These smart contracts manage the minting, trading, and ownership records of these fractions.\n- **NFT-Matrix Function:** Central to this platform is the innovative NFT-Matrix function, which allows for the complex fractionalization of NFTs. It divides an NFT into unique matrix-based fractions, each with a unique coordinate, enabling individual ownership of each segment.\n- **Decentralized Data Management:** Leveraging IPFS, the platform ensures decentralized and secure storage of all related data, including ownership records and transaction history, which supports the integrity and security of the fractional NFTs.",
