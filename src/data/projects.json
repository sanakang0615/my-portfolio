      "title": "Leveraging GraphSAGE for Location-Based Sales Analysis in F&B Franchises",
      "description": "Developed a GraphSAGE-based sales prediction model for F&B franchises, reducing RMSE by 10.6% compared to manual expert predictions. To operationalize the model, I built a full-stack web service using React and FastAPI, allowing internal experts to easily access and interact with the results. I was responsible for both the machine learning pipeline and the frontend interface, ensuring seamless integration between prediction logic and user experience.",
